TASK-1
To build a quiz application using JavaScript, we will create a dynamic, polished app where users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback. The app will use HTML and CSS for layout and styling, and vanilla JavaScript to manage logic like loading questions from an array, checking answers, updating scores, and dynamically switching to the next question without refreshing the page. Each question will display four options, and when a user selects an answer, immediate feedback ("Correct!" or "Wrong!") will appear along with a visual highlight. The app will also maintain and display the current score, with a final results page once all questions are completed. Additional features like animated transitions, a progress bar, and randomized question order can be included to enhance user engagement and create a smooth, responsive experience.

TASK-2

To build a real-time chat application, we will use WebSockets for live message exchange and a front-end framework like React.js (or Vue.js) to create a responsive, modern UI. The application will feature a clean chat interface where users can send and receive messages instantly without page reloads. The WebSocket connection will handle real-time communication with a server (e.g., Node.js + WebSocket library) and dynamically update the chat window as messages arrive. Message history will be maintained either temporarily in the browser state or persistently using a backend database. The design will include user avatars, timestamps, typing indicators, scrollable chat history, and mobile responsiveness, creating a smooth, interactive messaging experience across devices.

TASK-3


To design a basic portfolio website, we will create a responsive single-page layout using HTML and CSS, structured with sections like Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The navigation bar will use anchor links (`<a href="#section">`) for smooth scrolling to each section, and the Projects section will showcase individual project cards with images, titles, and brief descriptions. The design will be mobile-friendly using flexible grid or flexbox layouts, media queries for responsiveness, and a clean, professional color scheme. Styling will include subtle hover effects, soft shadows, and rounded corners to enhance the visual appeal, while fonts will be chosen for readability and elegance. The final site will be fully functional and visually polished, ideal for presenting a developer’s work online.

TASK-4
To design the front-end for an E-learning platform with course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding, we can use React.js for dynamic UI, TailwindCSS for quick and modern styling, and React Router for multi-page navigation. The platform will include a Home page with featured courses, an Explore Courses page with searchable and filterable course cards, a Course Details page with embedded videos and module lists, and a User Dashboard to track learning progress with visual progress bars. The design style will feature clean typography, soft shadows, rounded corners, and a calm color palette (Indigo, Cyan, Light Gray). Components like CourseCard, VideoPlayer, and ProgressBar will be reusable, responsive, and animated using Framer Motion for smooth UX. The directory structure will organize components and pages clearly, ensuring maintainability. Overall, the interface will be interactive, visually appealing, and fully responsive across devices.
